# Docker-K8s

This project is a hello world for Docker and K8s

## Docker

First we will pull a docker image. Most docker images are stored on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=), but many people create new docker images for their own purposes as well. Below is an example of a command to pull a docker image with C++ programming tools installed:
`docker pull eclipse/cpp_gcc`

Now that we have a local instance of the image, we can change it by using a dockerfile

## Kubernetes
